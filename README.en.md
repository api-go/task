## AES-GCM configuration compatibility

Released dependencies select crypto v1.5.9. Shared Symmetric.Decrypt/DecryptBytes authenticate `12-byte IV || ciphertext || 16-byte tag` first, then try the configured legacy IV. Existing APIs remain unchanged. Prefer EncryptBytesAutoIV for new data and upgrade readers before enabling writers. CBC/SM4 formats are unchanged.
